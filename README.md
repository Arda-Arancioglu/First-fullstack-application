## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application designed for creating, managing, and viewing forms. It features a secure Spring Boot backend, a responsive React frontend built with Vite, and a containerized MySQL database.

The application provides a seamless user experience with distinct functionalities for regular users and administrators. Users can register, log in, and interact with their forms on a personalized homepage. A key feature is the powerful admin panel, which grants administrators full control over the database to manage users, forms, and other data. To enhance user support, an AI-powered chatbot, running on a local Ollama instance with Llama 3, is available to answer questions and guide users through the application.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

  * **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (Version 17 or higher recommended)
  * **Node.js and npm** (Node.js LTS version recommended)
  * **Docker**
  * **Ollama** with the Llama 3 model pulled.
      * [Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)
      * Pull the model:
    ```sh
      ‚ùØ ollama pull llama3
    ```
    
### Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    ‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/Arda-Arancioglu/First-fullstack-application.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```sh
    ‚ùØ cd First-fullstack-application
    ```

3.  **Configure the Backend:**

      * Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
      * Create a `.env` file in this directory. This file will hold your database credentials.
      * Add the following content to your `.env` file, replacing `your_strong_password` with your actual MySQL password.
        ```env
        # .env
        DB_PASSWORD=your_strong_password
        ```

4.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**

      * While in the `backend` directory, let Gradle download the required dependencies.
      * On Windows:
        ```sh
        ‚ùØ gradlew build
        ```
      * On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        ‚ùØ ./gradlew build
        ```

5.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

      * Navigate to the frontend directory from the root folder: `cd frontend`
      * Install the dependencies using npm:

    **5.1 Scaffold your Vite¬†+¬†React app (if you haven‚Äôt already)**  
      
          npm create vite@latest form-app -- --template react
   
    **5.2 Enter the app directory**  
      
          cd form-app
   
    **5.3 Install all dependencies**  
      
          npm install
   
    **5.4 Start the development server**  
      
          npm run dev

## Running the Application

To run the application, you must start the services in the correct order.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Follow these steps sequentially.

1.  **Start the Database:**

      * Make sure Docker is running.
      * Start your MySQL container. Ensure the port and password match the configuration in your Spring Boot `application.properties` and `.env` files.

2.  **Start the AI Model:**

      * Run the Ollama service in your terminal to make the Llama 3 model available for the backend to connect to.
      * (Keep this terminal window open)

    <!-- end list -->

    ```sh
    ‚ùØ ollama run llama3
    ```

3.  **Run the Backend Server:**

      * Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `backend` directory.
      * Run the Spring Boot application using the Gradle wrapper.
      * On Windows:
        ```sh
        ‚ùØ gradlew bootRun
        ```
      * On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        ‚ùØ ./gradlew bootRun
        ```
      * The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

4.  **Run the Frontend Application:**

      * Open a final terminal window and navigate to the `frontend` directory.
      * Start the Vite development server.
        ```sh
        ‚ùØ npm run dev
        ```
      * The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port). Open this URL in your browser.
